While it may take longer to pay back the debt, interest and charges may continue accruing. The DMP provider could charge a fee, but there are free options like those offered by charities like Citizens Advice <ref>dOQ-BJgBBLViOYD1OzWM</ref>.\n\n<b>Debt Relief Order (DRO)</b>: If the client has a low income, little spare income, and assets under £1,000, they may qualify for a DRO. This freezes interest and charges for a year, after which the debt is written off if circumstances haven't improved.\n\n<b>Bankruptcy</b>: For larger debts where the client cannot afford payments, bankruptcy may be an option to write off most debts after assets are used to pay creditors. This has serious implications like losing assets and impacting credit rating.\n\nIt's crucial the client seeks free, impartial <b>debt advice</b> from Citizens Advice or other charities to understand all options based on their full financial circumstances <ref>dOQ-BJgBLViOYD1OzWM</ref>."
